This is a link to a free tool that launches a website/webapp from the terminal. There are many
like it, but this is what I use.
link: https://browsersync.io/
Instalation from the terminal: npm install -g browser-sync

Simple use of browsersync from the command line: browser-sync start -s -f
This command will launches your website from the command line!

Feel free to fork the repository and then clone into it and then add some more css properties to the drop down menu.

Just a simple fun css project
